### Dataset of Brazilian sub-national Covid-19 government response policies
Drawing on the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) [coding system](https://github.com/OxCGRT/Brazil-covid-policy/blob/master/documentation/codebook_subnational.md), we provide a systematic and objective account of the strength of Covid-19 response policies that have been instigated by Brazil’s federal, state, and state-capital governments.


### Survey data on citzens experiences and opinions relating to Covid-19 and government policies
We also present the original [results](https://github.com/OxCGRT/Brazil-covid-policy/blob/master/data/OxCGRT_Brazil_Subnational_31May2020.csv) of a survey of 1,654 citizens across eight state capitals. The survey was designed to ascertain the extent to which reality on the ground in these eight cities meets the World Health Organization’s (WHO) [list of recommendations](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331773/WHO-2019-nCoV-Adjusting_PH_measures-2020.1-eng.pdf)  of the measures that should be put in place before Covid-19 response policies can be safely relaxed.

The survey was conducted between 6 to 27 May. It uses randomised stratified sampling by age, sex, income and education level, with respondents drawn from a sampling frame that includes the telephone numbers of all landlines, and all mobile phones that use Vivo (the most common carrier in Brazil) as their carrier.
