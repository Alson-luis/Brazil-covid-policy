The following restrictions have been in place in Vitoria, although they were not determined by the city administration:    The Vitoria Airport was open as usual and had no screening policy in place until April 6.     According to the media, the airport screening policy is based on recommendations from the WHO and national guidance from the Ministry of Health and ANVISA (National Agency of Sanitary Vigilance). The airport administration also lies with the federal government, which could lead one to believe this is a federal policy. However, the latest ANVISA nation-wide recommendation has discouraged screening based on temperature measurement and the Vitoria policy seems to be implemented by the Secretariat of Health (SESA) of the State of Espirito Santo.     For the policy's purposes, the agency borrowed temperature measurement equipment from a private engineering firm through the State Secretariat of Science, Technology, Innovation and Professional Education (SECTI). The screening is carried out by one doctor, one nurse and three nursing technicians with support of members of the fire department.     In regard to the Port of Vitoria, differently from the airport, it was fully closed to foreign crew members for 30 days from March 26. On May 7, after arrivals had resumed, there has a confirmed COVID case of a crew member. He has been previously tested, however, in Rio de Janeiro, although the positive test results only came out when the ship had already arrived in Vitoria. All other crew members were subsequently screened (tested) in the Port due to his case. It appears that, to this moment, there is no general screening policy for all international crew arrivals in place. The Port claims that it is following federal guidance from ANVISA, which discourages temperature measurement.

There were also press conferences and ads in the traditional media. The first Instagram post raising awareness about preventive measures in the state government's account (@govmatogrosso) was on March 30, which I considered the start date of this policy.     On May 6, Governor Mauro Mendes was considered the governor who devoted the most time to address Covid in his profile. Of the total of 495 posts since March 1, he reserved 74% to alert the state population about the health crisis (source below).    In the city of Rondonopolis, in the end of April, sound-equipped cars also circulated in neighborhoods to spread information and orient citizens on preventive measures in their homes. However, it appears to be a city government measure.
